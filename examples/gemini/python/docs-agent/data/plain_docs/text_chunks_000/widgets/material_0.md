Flutter provides a variety of visual, behavioral, and motion-rich widgets
that implement the Material 3 design specification.
Material 3 is the default design language of Flutter,
enabling you to design and build beautiful, usable apps
that can adapt to any platform.
:::secondary
The transition to Material 3 as the default was
completed in Flutter 3.16.
To learn more about this transition, how to complete it for your own widgets,
or how to temporarily opt-out, check out
the Migrate to Material 3 migration guide.

To catch these and other widgets in action,
check out the Material 3 demo web app.

Find more widgets in the Material 2 widget catalog
and other categories of the widget catalog.
