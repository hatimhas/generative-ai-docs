| output-class                      | The Dart class name to use for the output localization and localizations delegate classes. The default is AppLocalizations. |
| preferred-supported-locales       | The list of preferred supported locales for the application. By default, the tool generates the supported locales list in alphabetical order. Use this flag to default to a different locale.For example, pass in [ en_US ] to default to American English if a device supports it. |
| header                            | The header to prepend to the generated Dart localizations files. This option takes in a string.For example, pass in "/// All localized files." to prepend this string to the generated Dart file.Alternatively, check out the header-file option to pass in a text file for longer headers. |
| header-file                       | The header to prepend to the generated Dart localizations files. The value of this option is the name of the file that contains the header text that is inserted at the top of each generated Dart file.  Alternatively, check out the header option to pass in a string for a simpler header.This file should be placed in the directory specified in arb-dir. |
| [no-]use-deferred-loading         | Specifies whether to generate the Dart localization file with locales imported as deferred, allowing for lazy loading of each locale in Flutter web.This can reduce a web app's initial startup time by decreasing the size of the JavaScript bundle. When this flag is set to true, the messages for a particular locale are only downloaded and loaded by the Flutter app as they are needed. For projects with a lot of different locales and many localization strings, it can improve performance to defer loading. For projects with a small number of locales, the difference is negligible, and might slow down the start up compared to bundling the localizations with the rest of the application.Note that this flag doesn't affect other platforms such as mobile or desktop. |
| gen-inputs-and-outputs-list      | When specified, the tool generates a JSON file containing the tool's inputs and outputs, named gen_l10n_inputs_and_outputs.json.This can be useful for keeping track of which files of the Flutter project were used when generating the latest set of localizations.  For example, the Flutter tool's build system uses this file to keep track of when to call gen_l10n during hot reload.The value of this option is the directory where the JSON file is generated.  When null, the JSON file won't be generated. |
| synthetic-package                 | Determines  whether the generated output files are generated as a synthetic package or at a specified directory in the Flutter project. This flag is true by default. When synthetic-package is set to false, it generates the localizations files in the directory specified by arb-dir by default. If output-dir is specified, files are generated there. |
| project-dir                       | When specified, the tool uses the path passed into this option as the directory of the root Flutter project.When null, the relative path to the present working directory is used. |
| [no-]required-resource-attributes | Requires all resource ids to contain a corresponding resource attribute.By default, simple messages won't require metadata, but it's highly recommended as this provides context for the meaning of a message to readers.Resource attributes are still required for plural messages. |
| [no-]nullable-getter              | Specifies whether the localizations class getter is nullable.By default, this value is true so that Localizations.of(context) returns a nullable value for backwards compatibility. If this value is false, then a null check is performed on the returned value of Localizations.of(context), removing the need for null checking in user code. |
| [no-]format                       | When specified, the dart format command is run after generating the localization files. |
| use-escaping                      | Specifies whether to enable the use of single quotes as escaping syntax. |
| [no-]suppress-warnings            | When specified, all warnings are suppressed. |
| [no-]relax-syntax                 | When specified, the syntax is relaxed so that the special character "" is treated as a string if it doesn't close any previous "{" that is treated as a special character. |
| [no-]use-named-parameters         | Whether to use named parameters for the generated localization methods. |
