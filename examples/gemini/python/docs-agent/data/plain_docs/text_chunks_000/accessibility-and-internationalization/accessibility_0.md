Ensuring apps are accessible to a broad range of users is an essential
part of building a high-quality app. Applications that are poorly
designed create barriers to people of all ages. The [UN Convention on
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities][CRPD] states the moral and legal
imperative to ensure universal access to information systems; countries
around the world enforce accessibility as a requirement; and companies
recognize the business advantages of maximizing access to their services.
We strongly encourage you to include an accessibility checklist
as a key criteria before shipping your app. Flutter is committed to
supporting developers in making their apps more accessible, and includes
first-class framework support for accessibility in addition to that
provided by the underlying operating system, including:
Large fonts
: Render text widgets with user-specified font sizes
Screen readers
: Communicate spoken feedback about UI contents
Sufficient contrast
: Render widgets with colors that have sufficient contrast
Details of these features are discussed below.
In addition to testing for these specific topics,
we recommend using automated accessibility scanners:


For Android:

Install the Accessibility Scanner for Android
Enable the Accessibility Scanner from
   Android Settings > Accessibility >
   Accessibility Scanner > On
Navigate to the Accessibility Scanner 'checkbox'
   icon button to initiate a scan



For iOS:

Open the iOS folder of your Flutter app in Xcode
Select a Simulator as the target, and click Run button
In Xcode, select
   Xcode > Open Developer Tools > Accessibility Inspector
In the Accessibility Inspector,
   select Inspection > Enable Point to Inspect,
   and then select the various user interface elements in running
   Flutter app to inspect their accessibility attributes
In the Accessibility Inspector,
   select Audit in the toolbar, and then
   select Run Audit to get a report of potential issues



For web:

Open Chrome DevTools (or similar tools in other browsers)
Inspect the HTML tree containing the ARIA attributes generated by Flutter.
In Chrome, the "Elements" tab has a "Accessibility" sub-tab
   that can be used to inspect the data exported to semantics tree
