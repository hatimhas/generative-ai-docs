Before building an API using the Dart intl package,
review the intl package's documentation.
The following list summarizes the process for
localizing an app that depends on the intl package:
The demo app depends on a generated source file called
l10n/messages_all.dart, which defines all of the
localizable strings used by the app.
Rebuilding l10n/messages_all.dart requires two steps.


With the app's root directory as the current directory,
    generate l10n/intl_messages.arb from lib/main.dart:
console
$ dart run intl_translation:extract_to_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/main.dart
The intl_messages.arb file is a JSON format map with one entry for
each Intl.message() function defined in main.dart.
This file serves as a template for the English and Spanish translations,
intl_en.arb and intl_es.arb.
These translations are created by you, the developer.


With the app's root directory as the current directory,
    generate intl_messages_<locale>.dart for each
    intl_<locale>.arb file and intl_messages_all.dart,
    which imports all of the messages files:
console
$ dart run intl_translation:generate_from_arb \
    --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading \
    lib/main.dart lib/l10n/intl_*.arb
Windows doesn't support file name wildcarding.
Instead, list the .arb files that were generated by the
intl_translation:extract_to_arb command.
console
$ dart run intl_translation:generate_from_arb \
    --output-dir=lib/l10n --no-use-deferred-loading \
    lib/main.dart \
    lib/l10n/intl_en.arb lib/l10n/intl_fr.arb lib/l10n/intl_messages.arb
The DemoLocalizations class uses the generated
initializeMessages() function
(defined in intl_messages_all.dart)
to load the localized messages and Intl.message()
to look them up.
