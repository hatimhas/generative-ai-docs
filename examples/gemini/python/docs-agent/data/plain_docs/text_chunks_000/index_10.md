Use global keys to uniquely identify child widgets.
Global keys must be globally unique across the entire
widget hierarchy, unlike local keys which need
only be unique among siblings. Because they are
globally unique, a global key can be used to
retrieve the state associated with a widget.
For more information, check out the GlobalKey API.
