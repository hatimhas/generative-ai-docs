Short for in-betweening. In a tween animation, the beginning
and ending points are defined, as well as a timeline, and a curve
that defines the timing and speed of the transition.
The framework calculates how to transition from the beginning point
to the end point.
The documents listed above, such as the
Animations tutorial, are not specifically
about tweening, but they use tweens in their examples.
