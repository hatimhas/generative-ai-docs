In physics-based animation, motion is modeled to resemble real-world
behavior. When you toss a ball, for example, where and when it lands
depends on how fast it was tossed and how far it was from the ground.
Similarly, dropping a ball attached to a spring falls
(and bounces) differently than dropping a ball attached to a string.
