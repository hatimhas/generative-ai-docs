With Flutter's animation library,
you can add motion and create visual effects
for the widgets in your UI.
One part of the library is an assortment of widgets
that manage animations for you.
These widgets are collectively referred to as implicit animations,
or implicitly animated widgets, deriving their name from the
ImplicitlyAnimatedWidget class that they implement.
The following set of resources provide many ways to learn
about implicit animations in Flutter.
