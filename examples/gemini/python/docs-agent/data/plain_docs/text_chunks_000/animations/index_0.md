Well-designed animations make a UI feel more intuitive,
contribute to the slick look and feel of a polished app,
and improve the user experience.
Flutter's animation support makes it easy to implement a variety of
animation types. Many widgets, especially Material widgets,
come with the standard motion effects defined in their design spec,
but it's also possible to customize these effects.
There are different approaches you can take when creating
animations in Flutter. Which approach is right for you?
To help you decide, check out the video,
How to choose which Flutter Animation Widget is right for you?

(To dive deeper into the decision process,
watch the Animations in Flutter done right video,
presented at Flutter Europe.)
As shown in the video, the following
decision tree helps you decide what approach
to use when implementing a Flutter animation:

If a pre-packaged implicit animation (the easiest animation
to implement) suits your needs, watch
Animation basics with implicit animations.
(Also published as a companion article.)

To create a custom implicit animation, watch
Creating your own custom implicit animations with TweenAnimationBuilder.
(Also published as a companion article.)

To create an explicit animation (where you control the animation,
rather than letting the framework control it), perhaps
you can use one of the built-in explicit animations classes.

If you need to build an explicit animation from scratch, watch

AnimatedBuilder and AnimatedWidget][].
