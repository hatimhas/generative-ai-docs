This tutorial gives you a foundation for creating animations in
Flutter using Tweens, but there are many other classes to explore.
You might investigate the specialized Tween classes,
animations specific to Material Design,
ReverseAnimation,
shared element transitions (also known as Hero animations),
physics simulations and fling() methods.
See the animations landing page
for the latest available documents and examples.
