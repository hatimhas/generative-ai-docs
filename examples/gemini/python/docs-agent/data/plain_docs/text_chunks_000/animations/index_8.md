In this pattern, the user selects an element—often an
image—from the page, and the UI animates the selected element
to a new page with more detail. In Flutter, you can easily implement
shared element transitions between routes (pages)
using the Hero widget.

Hero animations
  How to create two styles of Hero animations:
The hero flies from one page to another while changing position
    and size.

The hero's boundary changes shape, from a circle to a square,
    as its flies from one page to another.


Also see the API documentation for the
  Hero, Navigator, and PageRoute classes.
