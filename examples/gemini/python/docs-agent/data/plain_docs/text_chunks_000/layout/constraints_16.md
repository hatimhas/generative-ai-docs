dart
Center(
  child: Container(
    padding: const EdgeInsets.all(20),
    color: red,
    child: Container(color: green, width: 30, height: 30),
  ),
)
The red Container sizes itself to its children's size,
but it takes its own padding into consideration.
So it is also 30 Ã— 30 plus padding.
The red color is visible because of the padding,
and the green Container has the same size as
in the previous example.
