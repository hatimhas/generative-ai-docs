Perhaps you want to implement elastic scrolling,
also called scroll bouncing. Or maybe you want to
implement other dynamic scrolling effects, like parallax scrolling.
Or perhaps you want a scrolling header with very specific behavior,
such as shrinking or disappearing.
You can achieve all this and more using the
Flutter Sliver* classes.
A sliver refers to a piece of the scrollable area.
You can define and insert a sliver into a CustomScrollView
to have finer-grained control over that area.

Using slivers to achieve fancy scrolling
and the Sliver classes.
