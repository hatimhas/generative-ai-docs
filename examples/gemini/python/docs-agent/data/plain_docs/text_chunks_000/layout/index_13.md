Flutter has a rich library of layout widgets.
Here are a few of those most commonly used.
The intent is to get you up and running as quickly as possible,
rather than overwhelm you with a complete list.
For information on other available widgets,
refer to the Widget catalog,
or use the Search box in the API reference docs.
Also, the widget pages in the API docs often make suggestions
about similar widgets that might better suit your needs.
The following widgets fall into two categories: standard widgets
from the widgets library, and specialized widgets from the
Material library. Any app can use the widgets library but
only Material apps can use the Material Components library.
