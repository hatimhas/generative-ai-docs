Many layouts make liberal use of Containers to separate
widgets using padding, or to add borders or margins.
You can change the device's background by placing the
entire layout into a Container and changing its background
color or image.


Summary (Container)

* Add padding, margins, borders
* Change background color or image
* Contains a single child widget, but that child can be a Row,
    Column, or even the root of a widget tree
