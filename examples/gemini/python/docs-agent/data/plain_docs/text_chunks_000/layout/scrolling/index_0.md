Flutter has many built-in widgets that automatically
scroll and also offers a variety of widgets
that you can customize to create specific scrolling
behavior.
Many Flutter widgets support scrolling out of the box
and do most of the work for you. For example,
SingleChildScrollView automatically scrolls its
child when necessary. Other useful widgets include
ListView and GridView.
You can check out more of these widgets on the
scrolling page of the Widget catalog.
