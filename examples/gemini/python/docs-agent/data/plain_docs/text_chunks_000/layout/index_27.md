A Card, from the Material library,
contains related nuggets of information and can
be composed from almost any widget, but is often used with
ListTile. Card has a single child,
but its child can be a column, row, list, grid,
or other widget that supports multiple children.
By default, a Card shrinks its size to 0 by 0 pixels.
You can use SizedBox to constrain the size of a card.
In Flutter, a Card features slightly rounded corners
and a drop shadow, giving it a 3D effect.
Changing a Card's elevation property allows you to control
the drop shadow effect. Setting the elevation to 24,
for example, visually lifts the Card further from the
surface and causes the shadow to become more dispersed.
For a list of supported elevation values, see Elevation in the
Material guidelines.
Specifying an unsupported value disables the drop shadow entirely.
