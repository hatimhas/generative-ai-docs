To add an image to the center of your "splash screen",
navigate to .../ios/Runner.
In Assets.xcassets/LaunchImage.imageset,
drop in images named LaunchImage.png,
LaunchImage@2x.png, LaunchImage@3x.png.
If you use different filenames,
update the Contents.json file in the same directory.
You can also fully customize your launch screen storyboard
in Xcode by opening .../ios/Runner.xcworkspace.
Navigate to Runner/Runner in the Project Navigator and
drop in images by opening Assets.xcassets or do any
customization using the Interface Builder in
LaunchScreen.storyboard.
