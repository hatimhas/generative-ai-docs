To add a launch screen (also known as "splash screen") to your
Flutter application, navigate to .../android/app/src/main.
In res/drawable/launch_background.xml,
use this layer list drawable XML to customize
the look of your launch screen. The existing template provides
an example of adding an image to the middle of a white splash
screen in commented code. You can uncomment it or use other
drawables to achieve the intended effect.
