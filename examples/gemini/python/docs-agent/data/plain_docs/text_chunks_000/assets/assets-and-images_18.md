In your Flutter project's root directory,
navigate to .../ios/Runner. The
Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset directory already contains
placeholder images. Replace them with the appropriately
sized images as indicated by their filename as dictated by the
Apple Human Interface Guidelines.
Keep the original file names.
