Typography covers the style and appearance of
type or fonts: it specifies how heavy the font is,
the slant of the font, the spacing between
the letters, and other visual aspects of the text.
All fonts are not created the same. Fonts are a huge
topic and beyond the scope of this site, however,
this page discusses Flutter's support for variable
and static fonts.
Variable fonts (also called OpenType fonts),
allow you to control pre-defined aspects of text styling.
Variable fonts support specific axes, such as width,
weight, slant (to name a few).
The user can select any value along the continuous axis
when specifying the type.

However, the font must first define what axes are available,
and that isn't always easy to figure out. If you are using
a Google Font, you can learn what axes are available using
the type tester feature, described in the next section.
