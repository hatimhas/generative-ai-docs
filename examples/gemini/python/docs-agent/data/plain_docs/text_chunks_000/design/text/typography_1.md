The Google Fonts site offers both variable and static fonts.
Use the type tester to learn more about its variable fonts.

To investigate a variable Google font, go to the Google Fonts
   website. Note that in the upper right corner of each font card,
   it says either variable for a variable font, or
   x styles indicating how many styles a static
   font supports.
To see all variable fonts, check the Show only variable fonts
   checkbox.
Either scroll down (or use the search field) to find Roboto.
   This lists several Roboto variable fonts.
Select Roboto Serif to open up its details page.
On the details page, select the Type tester tab.
   For the Roboto Serif font,
   the Variable axes column looks like the following:


In real time, move the slider on any of the axes to
see how it affects the font. When programming a variable font,
use the FontVariation class to modify the font's design axes.
The FontVariation class conforms to the
OpenType font variables spec.
