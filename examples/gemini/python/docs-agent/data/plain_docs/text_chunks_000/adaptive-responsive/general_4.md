At this point, you must decide what sizing breakpoints to use
when choosing what version of the UI to display.
For example, the Material layout guidelines suggest using
a bottom nav bar for windows less than 600 logical pixels wide,
and a nav rail for those that are 600 pixels wide or greater.
Again, your choice shouldn't depend on the type of device,
but on the device's available window size.
To work through an example that switches between a
NavigationRail and a NavigationBar, check out
the Building an animated responsive app layout with Material 3.
The next page discusses how to ensure that your
app looks best on large screens and foldables.
