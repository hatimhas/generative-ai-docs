Beyond screen size, you should also spend time
considering the unique strengths and weaknesses
of different form factors. It isn't always ideal
for your multiplatform app to offer identical
functionality everywhere. Consider whether it makes
sense to focus on specific capabilities,
or even remove certain features, on some device categories.
For example, mobile devices are portable and have cameras,
but they aren't well suited for detailed creative work.
With this in mind, you might focus more on capturing content
and tagging it with location data for a mobile UI,
but focus on organizing or manipulating that content
for a tablet or desktop UI.
Another example is leveraging the web's extremely low barrier
for sharing. If you're deploying a web app,
decide which deep links to support,
and design your navigation routes with those in mind.
The key takeaway here is to think about what each
platform does best and see if there are unique capabilities
you can leverage.
