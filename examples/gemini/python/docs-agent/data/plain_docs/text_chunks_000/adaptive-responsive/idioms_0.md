PENDING: Leave this page out for now... In V2, I'd like to include it. Mariam suggested splitting it up by platform and I like that idea

The final area to consider for adaptive apps is platform standards.
Each platform has its own idioms and norms;
these nominal or de facto standards inform user expectations
of how an application should behave. Thanks, in part to the web,
users are accustomed to more customized experiences,
but reflecting these platform standards can still provide
significant benefits:


Reduce cognitive load
: By matching the user's existing mental model,
  accomplishing tasks becomes intuitive,
  which requires less thinking,
  boosts productivity, and reduces frustrations.


Build trust
: Users can become wary or suspicious
  when applications don't adhere to their expectations.
  Conversely, a UI that feels familiar can build user trust
  and can help improve the perception of quality.
  This often has the added benefit of better app store
  ratingsâ€”something we can all appreciate!


The first step is to spend some time considering what
the expected appearance, presentation,
or behavior is on this platform.
Try to forget any limitations of your current implementation,
and just envision the ideal user experience.
Work backwards from there.
Another way to think about this is to ask,
"How would a user of this platform expect to achieve this goal?"
Then, try to envision how that would work in your app
without any compromises.
This can be difficult if you aren't a regular user of the platform.
You might be unaware of the specific idioms and can easily miss
them completely. For example, a lifetime Android user is
likely unaware of platform conventions on iOS,
and the same holds true for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
These differences might be subtle to you,
but be painfully obvious to an experienced user.
