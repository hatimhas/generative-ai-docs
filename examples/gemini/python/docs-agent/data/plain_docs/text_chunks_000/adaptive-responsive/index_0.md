One of Flutter's primary goals is to create a framework
that allows you to develop apps from a single codebase
that look and feel great on any platform.
This means that your app might appear on screens of
many different sizes, from a watch, to a foldable
phone with two screens, to a high definition monitor.
And your input device might be a physical or
virtual keyboard, a mouse, a touchscreen, or
any number of other devices.
Two terms that describe these design concepts
are adaptive and responsive. Ideally,
you'd want your app to be both but what,
exactly, does this mean?
An easy way to think about it is that responsive design
is about fitting the UI into the space and
adaptive design is about the UI being usable in
the space.
So, a responsive app adjusts the placement of design
elements to fit the available space. And an
adaptive app selects the appropriate layout and
input devices to be usable in the available space.
For example, should a tablet UI use bottom navigation or
side-panel navigation?
:::note
Often adaptive and responsive concepts are
collapsed into a single term. Most often,
adaptive design is used to refer to both
adaptive and responsive.
