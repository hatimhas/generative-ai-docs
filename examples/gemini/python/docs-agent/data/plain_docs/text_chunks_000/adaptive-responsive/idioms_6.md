On touch devices, multi-selection is typically simplified,
with the expected behavior being similar to having the
isMultiSelectModifier down on the desktop.
You can select or deselect items using a single tap,
and will usually have a button to Select All or
Clear the current selection.
How you handle multi-selection on different devices depends
on your specific use cases, but the important thing is to
make sure that you're offering each platform the best
interaction model possible.
