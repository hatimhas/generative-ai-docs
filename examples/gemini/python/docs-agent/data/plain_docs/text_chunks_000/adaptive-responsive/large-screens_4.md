Adding support for more screens, also means
expanding input controls.
Android guidelines describe three tiers of large format device support.

Tier 3, the lowest level of support,
includes support for mouse and stylus input
(Material 3 guidelines, Apple guidelines).
If your app uses Material 3 and its buttons and selectors,
then your app already has built-in support for
various additional input states.
But what if you have a custom widget?
Check out the User input page for
guidance on adding
input support for widgets.
