Conforming to expected behaviors doesn't mean that your app
needs to use default components or styling.
Many of the most popular multiplatform apps have very distinct
and opinionated UIs including custom buttons, context menus,
and title bars.
The more you can consolidate styling and behavior across platforms,
the easier development and testing will be.
The trick is to balance creating a unique experience with a
strong identity, while respecting the norms of each platform.
