You might want to implement
drag and drop somewhere in your app.
You have a couple potential approaches
that you can take. One directly uses
Flutter widgets and the other uses a package
(super_drag_and_drop), available on pub.dev.
If you want to implement drag and drop within
your application, you can use the Draggable
widget. For insight into this approach, see
the Drag a UI element within an app recipe.
An advantage of using Draggable and DragTarget is
that you can supply Dart code to decide whether to accept a drop.
For more information, check out the
Draggable widget of the week video.
