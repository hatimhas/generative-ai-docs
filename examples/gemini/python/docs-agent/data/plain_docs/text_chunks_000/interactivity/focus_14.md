The FocusableActionDetector is a widget that combines the functionality of
Actions, Shortcuts, MouseRegion and a Focus widget to create
a detector that defines actions and key bindings, and provides callbacks for
handling focus and hover highlights. It is what Flutter controls use to
implement all of these aspects of the controls. It is just implemented using the
constituent widgets, so if you don't need all of its functionality, you can just
use the ones you need, but it is a convenient way to build these behaviors into
your custom controls.
