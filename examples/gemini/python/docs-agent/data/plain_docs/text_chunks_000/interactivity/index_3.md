A widget's state can be managed in several ways,
but in our example the widget itself,
FavoriteWidget, will manage its own state.
In this example, toggling the star is an isolated
action that doesn't affect the parent widget or the rest of
the UI, so the widget can handle its state internally.
Learn more about the separation of widget and state,
and how state might be managed, in Managing state.
