If you've already built the app in the
building layouts tutorial,
skip to the next section.

Make sure you've set up your environment.
Create a new Flutter app.
Replace the lib/main.dart file with main.dart.
Replace the pubspec.yaml file with pubspec.yaml.
Create an images directory in your project, and add
    lake.jpg.

Once you have a connected and enabled device,
or you've launched the iOS simulator
(part of the Flutter install) or the
Android emulator (part of the Android Studio
install), you are good to go!
