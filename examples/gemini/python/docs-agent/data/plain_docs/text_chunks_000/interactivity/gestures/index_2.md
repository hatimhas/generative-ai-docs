To listen to gestures from the widgets layer,
use a GestureDetector.

To learn more, watch this short
Widget of the Week video on the GestureDetector widget:

:::
If you're using Material Components,
many of those widgets already respond to taps or gestures.
For example, IconButton and TextButton
respond to presses (taps), and ListView
responds to swipes to trigger scrolling.
If you aren't using those widgets, but you want the
"ink splash" effect on a tap, you can use InkWell.
